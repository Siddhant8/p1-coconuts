## Project Plan ##

Summary: Our project involves creating a tea shop web server using Spring, and interacting with the tea shop in various ways. These “various ways” would be a jukebox, or ordering a beverage, or a coronavirus case tracker in the area (just to name a few). Some of these would be independent due to simplicity, but could also involve collaboration to blow them up in proportion. For example, the coronavirus tracker may start out as just a text box but then be blown up into an animation. 

## Projections (Ticket Items) ##
Aidan: I intend to first port over my Java code to Spring using my already-made MVC, then modifying it to work with HTML. I then intend to integrate with Andrew Hale's website somewhat (which means I may just use REACT instead of Spring). Lastly, I will try and study AWS, then reconfigure my JukeBox such that the information uploads to a server. Andrew Hale seems to be working on a server-like project, so I will also probably collaborate with him.<br> Week 1: HTML self-study plus any in-class lectures and convert Java to HTML <br> Week 2: Integrate with Andrew Hale's stuff (I dunno, add a game or a button that links to my site) <br> Week 3+: AWS and server stuff

## Delivery Plans and Content ##
Friday Plans: Update the scrum board with goals completed for the week to achieve the necessary goals for Night at the Museum. 

Night at the Museum: A spring website will be created through a local host. There will be a button to click for the tea shop, JukeBox, and coronavirus calculator.
